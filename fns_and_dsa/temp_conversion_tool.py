if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()




# if name == "main"

# This line checks whether the script is being run as the main program.

# __name__ is a special built-in variable in Python. When a script is executed directly, __name__ is set to "__main__".

# When the script is imported as a module in another program, __name__ is set to the name of the script/module.

# By using if __name__ == "__main__":, we ensure that certain code only runs when the script is executed directly, and not when it is imported. This is a common practice in Python scripts to allow code to be reusable as modules without executing the entire script upon import.

# main():

# This line calls the main function, which contains all the core logic of the script (such as user interaction, temperature conversion, and error handling).

# By placing the execution of the main function within the if __name__ == "__main__": block, we ensure that the script will proceed to prompt the user and perform conversions only when the script is run directly.

# Importance:
# Script Modularity: These lines allow the script to be both an executable program and an importable module. Other scripts can import temp_conversion_tool.py and use its functions without running the main() function. This promotes code reuse and modular programming.

# Control Execution Flow: They help control the flow of execution, ensuring that certain parts of the code (i.e., user interaction) only run in specific contexts. This makes the script more versatile and maintainable.
